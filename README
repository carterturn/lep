LEP
===

LEP is a home automation system for GNU/Linux.
LEP also provides music control through VLC.
LEP is secure (AES 128 bit) and distributed (ctsocket library).
LEP currently interfaces with an Arduino over USB. Support for the ESP2866 is expected soon.
This is the C++ LEP server, as well as speech, text, and GUI interfaces.
An Android app is being developed.
Example config files are provided, these will be better documented soon.

Current Issues:
==============

Password checking is not 100% accurate, certain false positives can occur.

Installation:
============

Once dependencies are installed:

mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
mv src/lep ../

At the moment, config files should be stored in the same directory as the LEP executable.
You will probably have to generate a new PocketSphinx language model, or download the default one.

Running:
=======

./lep [config file]

Example config files are included, please change the AES key and password

Dependencies:
============
SphinxBase and PocketSphinx (http://cmusphinx.sourceforge.net/)
espeak (with development files) (http://espeak.sourceforge.net/)
VLC (videolan.org)
	LEP uses VLC's remote control function on port 12515 (configurable) for music control
